If there is something in the original text you have trouble translating, try to find a way to work around it with the grammar you currently have OR invent a new construction to deal with it. In order to do the first one well you need a good awareness of your conlang's grammar. Another danger of this method is relexing the original, especially new vocabulary. Third option: Don't have your conlang be able to translate the challenging characteristic/expression of the text you're translating 'genuinely'.

I am not sure, and I couldn't find any reputable research indicating whether or not that is the case, but I suspect that when the language was being developed by Elgin she did not make it a tonal language by accident.

The school encouraged use of mouthing or fingerspelling Spanish, but the students, who were not native speakers of Spanish failed at learning these skills. Instead, they started communicating by using their own home signs, forming a pidgin that developed over the following years and was taught to younger students who later arrived.

The traditional ones, however, as set out by Joseph Greenberg, were more about syntax and only a little about morphology, which roots would probably fall under depending on what you want to do with them. Still, we can use the same techniques. We can look at what some real languages do with roots and try to figure out what they don't do, and then do that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roots in most languages are pretty static. They have to be, because they carry the majority of semantic content for a word, so they have to remain recognizable. Some languages, though, have morphology that alters what we would think of as the root in Western languages. In many Semitic languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, roots are combinations of consonants, usually three but sometimes two, and inflect by changing the vowels. In Arabic the consonants &lt;em&gt;k-t-b&lt;/em&gt; are a root that has to do with books and writing. The singular word &quot;book&quot; is &lt;em&gt;kitāb&lt;/em&gt;, the plural &quot;books&quot; is &lt;em&gt;kutub&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;booklet&quot; is &lt;em&gt;kutayyib&lt;/em&gt; with a suffix, &quot;writer&quot; is &lt;em&gt;kātib&lt;/em&gt;, and the verb &quot;to write&quot; is &lt;em&gt;kataba&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some languages also have infixes, which are affixes that are added inside the root instead of being added to the beginning (prefix) or end (suffix). Tagalog, for example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For example, the verb takbo (meaning to run) + the infix um can be made into the word tumakbo, which equates to the simple past tense past tense ran.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(From &lt;a href=&quot;http://talktagalog.com/tagalog-verbs-grammar-prefixes-infixes-suffixes/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://talktagalog.com/tagalog-verbs-grammar-prefixes-infixes-suffixes/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Arabic example, some of the morphology was inflectional, meaning it added some extra meaning to the original root--making a plural, for instance. Some was derivational, meaning we added something to the root that created a new root word--making &quot;books&quot; from &quot;book&quot; is inflectional, but making &quot;book&quot;,  &quot;writer&quot;, and &quot;to write&quot; from the root &lt;em&gt;k-t-b&lt;/em&gt; is derivational. So one possible meaning for &quot;root system&quot; is a system of derivational morphology, and a &quot;unique agglutinative root system&quot; would be a unique agglutinative system of derivational morphology. Speakers tend to regularize morphology over time, but derivational morphology is a little more resistant to it than inflectional: in English, nobody uses &quot;whom&quot; anymore, but we still preserve irregularities like &quot;&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;-vincible&quot; vs. &quot;&lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-beatable&quot; vs. &quot;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;-sexual&quot;. So with derivational morphology, you have a bit more freedom to concoct a weird, wild system without having to simulate a bunch of lazy peasant speakers who can't be bothered to keep using your fancy inflections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hopefully this gives you some ideas for how to create your own system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7" LastActivityDate="2018-02-06T22:51:42.083" CommentCount="0" />

For example linking verbs like is or looks will not be assigned gender because they are used to link the subject to the action verb or to adjectives and adverbs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pronouns practically already have gender in them. For example &quot;he&quot; is masculine. However &quot;he&quot; could also be neuter, at least in English because it can be used to refer to someone of unknown gender. &quot;it&quot; is clearly neuter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It does make sense though for all nouns and adjectives to have gender. And again, there are clear examples of where 1 gender makes far more sense. An example of that is the adjective &quot;pregnant&quot; It makes far more sense to say &quot;pregnant&quot; is feminine because male pregnancy, while possible, is extremely rare. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as for the assigning of gender I figured it would be like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Feminine Masculine Neuter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Latin had this 3 gender system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I am not so sure I would want inflections from grammatical case. I mean word order is a much simpler way to get across the same ideas as grammatical case.

But the possession marker is way simpler than inflecting every possessable noun for the genitive case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I was wondering, should adjectives agree with the noun in all aspects including gender or would a conlang where adjectives have inherent gender and don't have to agree with the noun when it comes to gender be just fine?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't want to use the concepts in English except maybe the pronouns, I am just using it as an example language for those concepts partly because that is the only language I know to fluency.

I am attempting to create a language which has grown, not one which was made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a complete enough language in terms of grammar and authentic enough for Jordan to use, though lacking in vocabulary.  From these quotes I get the feeling that he created the language well enough at one point that he didn't have to spend hours conlanging to be able to put a few sentences into his novels.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Wheel of Time Companion there was an English-Old Tongue dictionary, which is uploaded on Tor.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tor.com/2016/12/20/the-wheel-of-time-english-to-old-tongue-dictionary/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  At the beginning on the website (not sure if this is also in the book as I don't have it on me) this is written:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;While it is reminiscent of Tolkien’s ground-up creation of Elvish languages for The Lord of the Rings, The Old Tongue differs in that Jordan took a top-down approach, creating a dictionary of terms from which some basic suffixes, roots, and usage rules emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn't bother scrolling all the way down or counting the words, but it doesn't seem to have much grammar aside from the suffixes and stuff.  Although we don't have access to this, Jordan seems to be implying that the grammar does exist.  All I could find was &lt;a href=&quot;https://library.tarvalon.net/index.php?title=Old_Tongue_Dictionary_-_English#Grammar:&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on the Tar Valon library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastActivityDate="2018-02-06T23:49:07.157" CommentCount="2" />
